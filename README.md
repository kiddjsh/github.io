# github.io
a github pages portfolio project hosted by namecheap

# Updates
Currently undergoing a stylesheet three-band for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sections to separate
into individual slice files

# My Contact Form
Currently in TEST PHASE. It takes 48hrs or longer to propogate the network, when a change to the php file is made, for php services to automate the email sending process

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uses the PHP mail() function to send emails. With the PHP mail() function, emails are sent 
directly from my web server, from an email account that was created within cPanel, hosted
on my server, and using a local mail exchanger.
